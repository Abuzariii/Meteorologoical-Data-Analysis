## Abstract

The humidity has been consistent over the years but temperature has seen a slight increase in FInland since 2006. Even a slight increase at a geological scale has devastating effects not only on human health and safety, but to the ecosystem as well. Bear in mind that Finland is a North European country, where the effects of global warming are less compared to countries in Asia Pacific region. Nonetheless this has resulted in earlier blooming of plants and flowers, as well as an increase in the number of pests and diseases that thrive in warmer conditions. The warmer temperatures have also led to the melting of glaciers and permafrost in northern Finland, which is causing the land to shift and erode. This is having an impact on the country's infrastructure and wildlife habitats. Furthermore, the warming climate is leading to more frequent and intense heatwaves and storms, which can cause damage to buildings and infrastructure, and pose a risk to human health. Overall, global warming is having a significant impact on Finland's environment, economy, and society, and the country is working to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions and adapt to the changing climate
